# autoIT

## Description
An internal application portal to interface with disparate automations and ITSM tools through a single interface. An example workflow would be populating dropdowns with information pulled from ServiceNow configuration items, creating a change record and collecting approvals, executing a job in RedHat Automation Platform (Ansible Tower/AWX), and closing the change record.
